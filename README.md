Status: [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/TheBrazillianForgersTeam/BRCore/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/TheBrazillianForgersTeam/BRCore/latest)

The Core of the Team. Used in *almost* all Mods made by us.

...and a Lot of Functions to others mods...

1. A Ton of Helpers (As a v1.3, *8 helpers*, *2 managers*, and *counting...*)
2. Inter-Mods Compat made easier.

Want a Feature for the Core? Create a Issue in the Repository, then hope for the best.

## How to Build:
Before start:
* Know that `./` is the folder that has the folder `src` and the files `gradlew`, `gradlew.bat` and `build.gradle`
* If you are on Windows, replace `./gradlew` with `gradlew.bat`

(***If not yet,*** `./gradlew setupCIWorkspace` at least. (You can also do either `setupDevWorkspace` or `setupDecompWorkspace` instead, but it will take more time.))

***EXECUTE*** `./gradlew build`

In `./build/libs` you'll find:
`BRCore.jar` is for playing
`BRCore-dev.jar` is for modding (Also have the sources inside)

This is everything you need.
